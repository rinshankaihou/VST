# ORGANIZATION

The Verified Software Tool-chain is organized into separate sub-projects,
each in a separate directory:

- `msl` -   Mechanized Software Library
- `compcert` -  front end of the CompCert compiler, specification of C light
- `zlist` - theory of concatenable sublists, and list theory solver
- `sepcomp` - the theory and practice of how to specify shared-memory interaction
- `veric` -  program logic (and soundness proof) for Verifiable C
- `floyd` -  tactics for applying the separation logic (some tactics still require debugging)
- `progs64` -  sample programs, with their verifications
- `shared` - share algebra, may be useful in developments for other languages

## USING VST

To use either of these interactive development environments you will
need to have the right load path.  This can be done by command-line
arguments to coqide or coqtop.  The precise command-line arguments
to use when running CoqIDE or coqc are constructed automatically when
when you do "make", in the following files:

- `_CoqProject-export`: For VST users, running the IDE outside the VST directory
- `_CoqProject` : For VST developers, running the IDE in the VST directory

### WITH COQIDE

From the VST root directory, run `./coqide` to run coqide with recommended options.
(Read the script for more info.)

### WITH PROOF GENERAL

Use the `_CoqProject` file generated by the Makefile
   (Yes, we know, normally it's the other way 'round, normally one generates
    a Makefile from the `_CoqProject`.)

## NEW DIRECTORIES

If you add a new directory, you will probably want to augment the loadpath
so that qualified names work right.  Edit the `OTHERDIRS` or `VSTDIRS` lines of
the `Makefile`.
